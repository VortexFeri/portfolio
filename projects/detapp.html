        <h1>C++ Object Detection Application</h1>
        <h2>Main Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a detector to use on your image/video</li>
            <li>Save a screenshot of the detected image/video</li>
            <li>Adjust the confidence threshold of the detector (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Apply some filters to the image/video before applying the detector</li>
        </ul>

            During my Software Development Internship at Siemend, I brushed up on my C++ programming skills, by building a desktop application that allows you to upload trained AI detection models and see the results in real-time as well as apply different image processing algorithms and see how those results are affected. You may filter and annotate the found objects and fine-tune the model configuration until you find the settings that are suitable for your model.

            I learned about the Qt6 UI API, as well as the CMake scripting and building utility. I learned a lot about common programming design patterns, clean code and the SOLID principles. During the development of this application, I worked in a duo with a fellow co-worker. That helped me improve my team work spirit, but it also helped me make better use of Git and its features, in order to be more efficient when I comes to code documentation, conflict merging and good pull requests.
