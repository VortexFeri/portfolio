        <h2>Main Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect data about soil humidity, temperature and environmental light</li>
            <li>UV LED strips for when there is no natural light available</li>
            <li>Water tank and pump for when the soil gets dry</li>
            <li>Display screen for showing information</li>
            <li>Web application displaying real-time and historical data, with sensor values periodically stored in a CSV file
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>More details</h2>
        <p>
            It is a smart plant box equipped with sensors for monitoring the soil humidity and environmental light, and will try to help the plant grow healthy by automatically providing it with water and light when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has a TFT screen that shows humidity, light, and temperature information as well as a little face so you know the status of your plant at a first glance.
        </p>
        <p>
            It hosts a web server and stores historical sensor data in a CSV file. You may access the website and check past and current sensor values.
        </p>

        <p>
            The biggest challenge I had to face was the imminent loss of memory. As the MCU only had 2KB of SRAM, I had to find solutions while implmenting some features, to save as much of it as possible, and not allow the lack of memory affect other features.
        </p>

        <p>
            While my teammates assisted with soldering components, 3D-printing and assembling the exterior case. I was responsible for the coding.
